Super Sticky Notes

This app allows users to jot down notes on digital sticky notes, which are then displayed. Each note can have a title as well as a message. Once created, notes are searchable via any phrase occurring in either the title or message. Notes can be deleted or created as needed, and are stored locally between browser sessions.
